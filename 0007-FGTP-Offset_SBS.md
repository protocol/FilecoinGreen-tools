## Title
Filecoin Green Tool Proposal template

## Abstract
Offset the travel-related emissions generated by all attendees & speakers *to* and *from* the [Sustainable Blockchain Summit](https://sbs.tech/).

## Status

Active - Please refer to the [SBS Attendee List Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNSmDINZgCaWWIU5Z0_F0abqm3DLTfzDBrns8be0NCk0Fl1g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0)

## What is the goal

The Filecoin Green Team is committed to making the Sustainable Blockchain Summit as carbon neutral as possible. 

One of the primary ways we are doing this is by offsetting the emissions generated by the travel of our attendees and speakers. 

To achieve this goal, we are collecting relevant travel-related information from all Attendees and Speakers.

## What are the inputs

We have built a Google form, titled [SBS Attendee List Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNSmDINZgCaWWIU5Z0_F0abqm3DLTfzDBrns8be0NCk0Fl1g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) that asks for name, wallet address / ENS, origin & destionation location, mode(s) of transportation to & from Paris, and if attendees have already Offset their travel-related emissions.

## What are the outputs

We will use the Form data to calculate the to emissions impact of the collective travel of all attendees and speakers *to* and *from* SBS. This calculation will be conducted according to the [International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Methodology](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v11-2018.pdf), which employs a distance-based approach to estimate an individualâ€™s
aviation emissions using data currently available on a range of aircraft types, and reinforced by the [Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework Methodology](https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/glec-framework-implementation/).

## Proposed Solution

Once the total emissions impact is calculated, the Filecoin Green team will:

1. Multiple the total emissions impact by a factor of 2X, to build in a margin of safety. 
2. Seek input from Web3 Carbon Credits providers to procure enough high-quality offsets to cover the travel-related emissions impact of SBS.
3. Seek input from the SBS Speakers to provide vote on which Offsets are appropriate to cover the travel-related emissions impact of SBS.
4. Procure Offsets and register them on Filecoin via [CO2.Storage](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0006-FGTP-CO2_Storage.md).
5. Airdrop tokens to all attendees and speakers with details of offset activity. 
6. Publish a carbon accounting record for SBS, including ratings for all offsets considered. 

## Implementations and Artifacts
